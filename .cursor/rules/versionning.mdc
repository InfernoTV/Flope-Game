# Automatic Version Increment
Maintain a single source of truth for the version inside (APP_VERSION) and in .cursor\versions.md.
On every accepted code modification, increment the version number by +0.01 (e.g., 0.00 → 0.01).
After bumping the version:
Update the APP_VERSION constant.
Reflect the same value in any UI surface that renders the version string.
Append a new entry into .cursor\versions.md using the provided template.

# Recording Changes
Document all additions, removals, and behavioral changes inside .cursor\versions.md.
Keep historical entries immutable; only append.

These rules ensure Cursor-based edits keep the desktop app, web dashboard, and documentation in sync without manual bookkeeping.
